# GenCareAI
Developing AI-driven nursing home care notes for preliminary machine learning experiments.

This repository is a fork of the GenCareAI repository by [Eva Rombouts](https://github.com/ekrombouts/GenCareAI).
The GenCareAI project is an initial step in exploring how NLP techniques can be used to automate the creation of care plans in nursing homes. This specific fork focuses on English language notes.

## Project overview
**Fictitious Data Creation:** We use OpenAI to create a realistic, yet entirely fictional, dataset of client records. This protects the privacy and upholds the ethical handling of sensitive patient data.
**Data Analysis:** Notes were assessed by a qualified nurse to determine quality. Additionally, notes were blindly labelled by the nurse to compare against the model's labels. Readability metrics were also calculated.
